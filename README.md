# HomeTask1: MVVM-C

Architectures
Make a MVVM-C app:
- hardcoded login with creds user/123qwe checked by viewmodel
- navigates to list of stings fetched from
https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=8&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=plain&rnd=new

- protocol binding
- unit tests for:
+ ViewModels,
+ FlowController,
+ Network Request (Correct Url + Parsing of template contract test, not an API test!)
